FAQ
Which browser works best with uBO?

uBlock Origin works best in Mozilla Firefox. The features supported only on Firefox include preventing unwanted DNS requests and CNAME uncloaking.



Should I use a content blocker if I have Pihole, NextDNS, ControlD, etc.?

uBlock Origin can do more compared to when only blocking requests at the DNS-level, like using cosmetic filters to hide first-party ads (e.g., YouTube ads), ad-placeholders, web annoyances, etc.1
Why should I use these lists?



Why did you include AdGuard's Optimize lists but not AdBlock Plus' Minified lists?

The Minified lists are part of an Adblock Plus-hosted unofficial project that was hardforked from their source lists in August 2019. They are smaller than AdGuard's Optimized lists but lack quality blocking. Because EL and EP are your primary defenses with content blocking, I wouldn't use the Minified lists.
